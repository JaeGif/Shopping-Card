# GamePlan

This project is a shopping cart application made entirely in React, using React Router, and UI Testing via Jest.

The products are rendered from a mutable .js file. It returns a js object, but since it's a local file, I decided not to use Fetch API/.json and just import the file for faster speed.

Features:

- Dynamic Routing: /, /store with the cart available on all pages
- Adding and Removing items from the cart
- NO CHECKOUT THIS IS NOT A SHOP IT IS A PROTOTYPE TO PRACTICE REACT.js, nothing can actually be purchased. The products and images are not mine. I only claim copyright to the design and code of the website itself, none of the assets used in development.
- Engaging and Pretty UI
